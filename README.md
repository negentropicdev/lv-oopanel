# oopanel

A library that manages user interface panels, both windows and subpanel inserts, while supporting a By-Reference implementation. This library includes an additional PanelArray manager that allows the creation of custom arrays based on these OOP panels. This feature is useful in the creation of recipe editors with varying step types, configuration lists with purpose built interfaces per item, and so-on.
